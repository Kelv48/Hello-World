# üåç Hello World in Different Languages

This repository showcases a collection of simple "Hello World" programs written in various programming languages. 
It's a great starting point for beginners to see how the basic syntax varies across languages and a handy reference for anyone looking to get familiar with a new language.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

All the "Hello World" programs are located within the `Hello-World` directory, with each file named according to the language.

## üõ†Ô∏è Languages Included

- **C**: A low-level programming language known for its speed and efficiency.
- **C++**: An extension of C that adds object-oriented features.
- **C#**: A language developed by Microsoft, often used for Windows applications.
- **Java**: A versatile language commonly used for cross-platform applications.
- **JavaScript**: The language of the web, primarily used for client-side scripting.
- **Python**: A high-level, easy-to-read language popular for web development, data science, and automation.
- **Lua**: A lightweight, embeddable scripting language.
- **Ruby**: A dynamic, open-source language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.

## üöÄ Running the Programs

To run each "Hello World" program, follow the instructions below for each language:

1. **C**
    - Compile: `gcc HelloWorld.c -o HelloWorld`
    - Run: `./HelloWorld`

2. **C++**
    - Compile: `g++ HelloWorld.cpp -o HelloWorld`
    - Run: `./HelloWorld`

3. **C#**
    - Compile & Run: `csc HelloWorld.cs && HelloWorld.exe`
    - <i>csc is the C# compiler, which is part of the .NET framework. Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed.</i>
    Compiling HelloWorld.cs produces an executable named HelloWorld.exe by default.
    Run the program by typing HelloWorld.exe in the terminal.

4. **Java**
    - Compile: `javac HelloWorld.java`
    - Run: `java HelloWorld`

5. **JavaScript**
    - Run: `node HelloWorld.js`

6. **Python**
    - Run: `python HelloWorld.py`

7. **Lua**
    - Run: `lua helloworld.lua`

8. **Ruby**
    - Run: `ruby helloworld.rb`

####C 
For csc, you need to have .NET SDK installed. You can download it from the [download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) page.         
For gcc and g++, you need to have them installed. On Linux, you can install them via your package manager (e.g., sudo apt install build-essential). 
On Windows, consider using MinGW or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). On macOS, they can be installed with Xcode command-line tools (xcode-select --install)

####Java
Make sure you have java installed on your system. You can check by running
java -version
javac -version

####JavaScript
To run a JavaScript file (HelloWorld.js) you can use Node.js which is a Javascript runtime environment.
Steps to run
1. Make sure Node.js is installed | node -v
2. Run the file | node HelloWorld.js

####python
Make sure python is installed | python --version
Then run the file | python HelloWorld.py

####Lua
Check if its installed | lua -v
Run the file | lua helloworld.lua

####Ruby
Check if installed | ruby -v
Run the ruby file | ruby helloworld.rb
